# employeeTracker

## Description

The employeeTracker is an app that can update a database of employees to help improve the orginization of a companies work force. The motivation behind this was to learn more about how to utilize MySQL.

I learned a lot about how to control what happens in a database from this project and will use what I learned to delve even deeper on the back-end side of coding.
